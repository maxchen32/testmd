<div style="font-weight: bold;text-align: center;font-family: Georgia, sans-serif;">

&nbsp;
In the town where I was born  <br/>

Lived a man who read the books<br/>  

And he told us of his life<br/>


In the land of silk and tea<br/>

His limbs were stiff and he could not move<br/>

could not move,<br/>

could not move<br/>

&nbsp;
When he was young he was a poor<br/>

But he still went to read<br/>

In the trip with wind and snow<br/>

He carried books in his shoes<br/>

His limbs were stiff and he could not move,<br/>

could not move,<br/>

could not move<br/>

&nbsp;
And his mates, wore silk and swords<br/>

Many of them, enjoyed all day<br/>

But he had never done the same<br/>

He had never done the same<br/>

His limbs were stiff and he could not move<br/>

could not move,<br/>

could not move<br/>

&nbsp;
After years, in the palace he answered<br/>

The questions from the emperor<br/>

Someone thought he said to show it<br/>

Made him could not move<br/>

His limbs were stiff and he could not move<br/>

could not move,<br/>

could not move<br/>

&nbsp;
Limbs were stiff and he could not move,<br/>

could not move,<br/>

could not move<br/>

His limbs were stiff and he could not move<br/>

could not move,<br/>

could not move<br/>

His limbs were stiff and he could not move,<br/>

could not move,<br/>

could not move<br/>
